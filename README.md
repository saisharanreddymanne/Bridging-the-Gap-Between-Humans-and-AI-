# Analytical Review of Explainable Artificial Intelligence: Bridging the Gap Between Complexity and Interpretability


** Abstract: **
 
 In this study, we assess and compare the two most
 popular machine learning algorithms, Logistic Regression and
 LightGBM, for a binary classification problem. The classifiers
 are trained and tested on a dataset and metrics such as accuracy
 or recall are used to evaluate their performance. The Accuracy
 score for Logistic Regression classifier is 0.855, with a precision
 of 0.80 and 0.91 for the two classes, respectively. Recall is 91%
 and 80%, and the corresponding F1-scores are 85% and 86%
 respectively. The error matrix demonstrated that the model
 identified accurately 85 examples as positive and 86 examples
 as negative while misclassifying 21 negative examples as positive
 and 8 positive instances as negative. While on the other hand
 the LightGBM classifier comes out on top with an accuracy
 of 0.90. Its precision values are 0.85 and 0.94, and the recall
 values are 0.94 and 0.86, respectively. The F1-scores achieved for
 the classes are and 0.90. A confusion matrix demonstrates that
 LightGBM has correctly classified 92 positive and 87 negative
 instances with 15 false negatives and 6 false positives. The findings
 show that LightGBM outperforms Logistic Regression in the
 aspects of overall accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for
 this certain binary classification problem. The higher accuracy
 and better performance metrics of LightGBM can be contributed
 to its capability of handling complex decision boundaries and its
 robustness to overfitting by regularization techniques. This study
 presents both classifiers side by side and emphasizes the fact that
 for binary classification problems with challenging data features
 LightGBM is worth being used.

# INTRODUCTION

 In the age of discreetly progressing technology, the AI
 and ML tools take the place of a colossal force in the
 elements of business. It may well be considered one of the
 maximum difficult but promising aspects that in this field
 exist Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) As AI evolves
 into comprehensive structures that find their way into critical
 decision-making frameworks, the issue of transparency and
 explaining assumptions to an average person will become
 intensely important. The paper titled ”Explainable artificial
 talent: Nurturing more cohesiveness in humanity.
 Fig. 1. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)
 To build a machine learning model, XAI analyzes training
 data, as seen in Figure 1 . After then, forecasts and judgments
 are made using the model. Furthermore, XAI models—as
 opposed to traditional AI models—may provide an explanation
 for their reasoning.
 ”Complexity and Interpretability”” as one of the most
 highlighting concerns would be dealt with in this paper,
 underlying the scope of improvements and methodologies that
 could enhance the understanding of artificial intelligence’s
 complexity by humans [1].
 An overarching general purpose of this assignment and
 oral presentation is to provide an analytic evaluation for a
 hand picked article. Through our reasoning we will shed light
 on essential aspects of the research, including its findings,
 
# A. Foundations of Explainable AI

 methodologies, and insights. The ultimate purpose will be to
 gain a good inside of how effective preventive maintenance
 ways can be adopted to achieve greater productivity. The
 main principle of predictive maintenance is relative to a high
 stress accuracy of forecasting of failures and malfunctioning
 of the operating systems. The MLE is about a significant (AI)
 and (ML) technology that has incredible (opportunities) to
 optimize those prediction skills, but also there are challenges
 such as (transparency), (trust) and (responsibility).
 A selected task in the present paper caters to the face
 of obstruction and deals with it in multiple ways including
 approaches and techniques aimed at improving AI models
 transparency and interpretability. Through how the authors un
cover the complicated layers of the AI algorithms framework,
 they present present day cookouts which provide employees to
 have a stake in the decision-making processes of such systems.
 Such coherence takes a toll on confidence as the transparent
 inclusion of AI driven solutions is legitimized in key areas
 such as predictive maintenance.
 In addition, this study extends beyond mere predictive
 preservation as it strives to acquaint readers with technology
 and appreciating how it influences the way we live. Hence,
 AI’s growing incision in different directions will make this
 ethical put forth become a catchphrase and thus the inquiry
 extends to explainable and responsible AI approaches. As a
 result, acknowledging with the full stature of the XAI is not
 conclusive just by putting it into the predictive maintenance
 systems, but also it is associated with ethics, crime and society
 that are the key issues with AI future.
 Let us start with a higher resolution review of the paper’s
 main theme, which will be divided into sections to present the
 principle ideas, methods and conclusions, one by one. There
 is therefore the last portion where I am going to narrate to
 you some major accomplishments of our works and how the
 data sources that we are still harvesting is contributing to the
 f
 ield of predictive conservation. In such a manner, exploring
 these specific elements of XAI is our main purpose, which is
 aimed at formulating an overall notion of what exactly XAI
 could effectively be employed for, in a variety of industrial
 circumstances as well as in other situations.



# APPROACH AND METHODS

# A. Set of rules Description

 The paper demonstrates the use of the supervised machine
 learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression (LR) and
 LightGBM (LGM) in predictive maintainance, as well. Lo
gistic Regression (LR) stands for statistical method used with
 two-class problems; as the response is either a ”success or
 failure” or a ”yes or no.” Its functions become more crucial
 when the prediction concerns the occurrence of an incident
 that is unlikely to happen in a given period. On the other hand,
 LGM (LightGBM), a more powerful linear gradient boosting
 framework, is the one that can handle both classification and
 regression tasks. It is famous for high processing speed as
 well as for protection from overfitting to the training data
 via gradient boosting algorithms. The paper distinguishes and
 compares these two algorithms (LR and LGM) on binary
 classification proclivity involving predictive maintenance. The
 f indings of the work indicated that in general LGM performed
 better than LR in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F1
score. The LGM classifier reported accuracy values of 0.90
 with the precision measures for both the classes being 0.85
 and 0.94 respectively. The recall values were 0.94 and 0.86
 and corresponding F1-score values were 0.89 and 0.90. The
 confusion matrix indicates that LGM correctly classified 92
 cases as positive and 87 cases as negative cases with 15 of the
 positive cases missed and 6 of these falsely being classified
 as negative. However, LR classifier was of greater accuracy
 (0.855) with 0.80 and 0.91 precision values respectively for
 both classes. The recall values were 0.91 and 0.80, the F1
Score was 0.85 and 0.86. The confusion matrix displays the
 fact that the LR model correctly labeled 85 instances as
 positive and 86 as negative, while in the process mislabeled
 21 negative instances as positive and 8 positive instances as
 negative. [5].
 
 # B. Re implementation technique:
 
 In order to visualize and get an improved version for the
 announced plans, we wholly relied on a systematic approach
 that does not overlook details. First of all,we should have a
 look on the processes that research has mentioned and, on the
 other hand, we have a different understanding of processes that
 have been included in the survey. The mentioned processes
 such as tailoring of functions were also employed on special
 sensors to aid the process of deriving relevant insights from the
 sensor data. This new requirement was considered as an initial
 part of the algorithm and was believed as a key to increase
 the ability of the model to predict the results.
 On the final stage of the process logistic regression was
 even applied along with selection tree models for training.
 Equally, it was decided to use the data files of education and
 validation used by the authors as datasets. While ensuring the
 un changeability in the experimental setting, we extract values
 from chores concerning hyper parameters, model configura
tions and evaluation metrics to achieve an exact reproduction
 of the original effect. The severe process of following the
 specified design for the experiment stood for the comparison
 of the above-stated contrasts where the review of the smart
 measures was done and the credibility of the paper assessment
 was made according to the needed approved testing technique. 
 
 # C. Tools and technologies
 
 In the process of implementing and measuring the outcome
 on the predefined real-world situation, we had to resort to the
 Python programming considering its capability for very high
 and complex programming. Python alongside with its large
 number of libraries enables to utilize additional knowledge
 around application of algorithms, statistical processing, and
 charts creation .
 It became so obvious to take interest in the NLP algorithms
 that are found in the scikit-study module because it provides an
 impression of the huge range of algorithmic tools and utilities
 available in the library. Besides pandas library we as well
 used features selection approach based on green background
 data demand including collection and processing steps what is
 also ETL strategy actualization prerequisite in terms of model
 training.
 The technological tools that involved in using these devices
 as well as the technologies themselves was the crucial step
 taken to be as accurate as possible, reproducible and scalable
 among all the processes described. Using technologies that
 can streamline and standardize our work no longer takes long
 thanks to the setting up process of libraries and frameworks
 and we will have more confirmation on the reality of predictive
 maintenance in a short period [6].

# RESULT AND DISCUSSION

# A. Improved Result

 These numbers underscore that by re-implementing in the
 decision trees repairing procedures as well as logistic regres
sion developing predictive maintenance, the models are show
ing improved performance. We realized that the crucial thing
 is a highly accurate imitation of info articulation processes
 and constant adjustments of model settings by soaring count
 of iteration process’s hyperparameters. This approach resulted
 in the evolution of more precise and reliable algorithms. But
 logistic regression along with Light GBM have extended to be
the main components in the strategy as well, helping to ensure
 positive effect in regards to predictive power.
 
 # B. Accuracy and Precision
 
 The logistic regression model provided a high increase
 in accuracy percentage compared to 85 percent of accuracy,
 which is also is shown in our research, evidently. That ratio
 elaborates the success of the function enforcing methods
 applied which implied the model to be full in picture of the
 complicated associations and micro level patterns within the
 sensor data. Through close monitoring of features and careful
 adjustment of model parameters, we could to a considerable
 extent boost the discriminative power of the model in iden
tifying nuances in the data that help the model grow better
 in predicting outcomes somewhat unmatched by previous
 models.

 The classifier LGBM Classifier() excelled. It displayed out
standing performance and, in the end, obtained a satisfactory
 accuracy of 89 percent prediction. Interesting, this improves
 the potency of improved methods that may be incorporated,
 such as gradient-boosting, which is a kind of approach that
 LightGBM uses to update its platform. Pressing on the advent
 of such innovations like LightGBM makes it possible for
 correlating a massive amount of sensor data and providing
 output of a productively employed data analysis. The natural
 disadvantage of LightGBM to find relationships and inter
dependency among in each data set, as it is the intrinsic need
 for standard system to traditional comparison methods, was
 the key for our model to be very accurate in our predictions.
 Among all, the hierarchical design of gradient boosting not
 only increased the accuracy in prediction, but also remove all
 the unwanted elements that lead into the system failure [7].
 Also, it provides the methods of filtering out the features
 that are crucial to the decision-making process, which in
 turn increases the exactness of the prediction system. Due
 to the successful integration of Light GB as a package not
 only the algorithms involved in the machine learning improve
 the model prediction with respect to assets but how fast
 the response will be and by directly setting the maintenance
 strategy up.

 using two key metrics also, the wrongly-classified samples can
 be used a to the evaluating the accuracy of the classification
 process and to compare the various model results. The confu
sion matrix is, in fact, able to converge information about the
 model’s accuracy just based on the true positive, true negative,
 false positive and false negative [8].

 # Fig. 5. Confusion Matrix for Logistic Regression
 
 Utilizing the error analysis in this context, we could ac
knowledge the regions that require improvement, e.g. limiting
 the amount of false positives and false negatives. On one
 hand, the ROC shows how there is a distinct trade-off of
 TPR(True Positive Rate) and FPR(False Positive Rate) at any
 classification threshold shown in fig 6. The more the model
 AUCscore converges towards 1.0, the more accurate the model
 performance will be. This intersection of confusion matrix
 and ROC curve graphs will provide us to the possibility of
 understanding these terms on their proper basis.
